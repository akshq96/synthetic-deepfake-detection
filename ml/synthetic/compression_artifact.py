"""JPEG re-compression artifact injection: re-encode at a random low quality
(optionally twice, simulating double-compression) then decode. Simulates the
recompression traces manipulated videos often carry after re-encoding.

Also reused (deliberately) by the robustness-evaluation perturbations
(ml/evaluation/experiments/robustness.py, Phase 6) — see the caveat in the
project plan / docs/methodology.md once written: a model trained with this
technique in its synthetic mix must not have its "robustness to compression"
reported without flagging that as a controlled, expected result rather than
general robustness.
